   This document is a guide for installing Arch Linux from the live system
   booted with the official installation image. Before installing, it
   would be advised to view the FAQ. If looking for a more detailed
   installation guide see the Beginners' guide, or Category:Getting and
   installing Arch for specific installation cases.

   Most help can be found on the wiki or through the various programs' man
   pages; see archlinux(7) for an overview of the configuration. For
   interactive help, the IRC channel and the forums are also available.

Pre-installation

   Download and boot the installation medium as explained in
   Category:Getting and installing Arch, then proceed with the rest of
   this guide.

   The installation process needs to retrieve packages from a remote
   repository, therefore a working internet connection is required.

  Set the keyboard layout

   The default keyboard layout is US. Alternative keyboard layouts can be
   loaded with loadkeys keymap_file: keymap files can be found in
   /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/ (path and file extension can be ommitted).

  Connect to the Internet

   Internet service via DHCP discovery is enabled on boot for supported
   wired devices; read more at Network configuration. For supported
   wireless devices run wifi-menu to set up the network; read more with
   Wireless network configuration. If needing a static IP or network
   management tools, stop the DHCP discovery service with systemctl stop
   dhcpcd@eth0.service, and read Netctl.

  Update the system clock

   See systemd-timesyncd.

  Partition the disks

   See Partitioning for details; some special partitions may be needed,
   see EFI System Partition and GRUB BIOS boot partition. If wanting to
   create any stacked block devices for LVM, disk encryption or RAID, do
   it now.

  Format the partitions

   See File systems and optionally Swap for details.

  Mount the partitions

   Mount the root partition on /mnt. After that, create directories for
   and mount any other partitions (/mnt/boot, /mnt/home, ...) and activate
   your swap partition if you want them to be detected later by genfstab.

Installation

  Select the mirrors

   Edit /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist and select a download mirror(s). Regional
   mirrors usually work best; however, other criteria may be necessary to
   discern, read more on Mirrors. This copy of the mirrorlist file will
   later be copied on the new system by pacstrap, so it is worth getting
   it right.

  Install the base packages

   Use the pacstrap script to install the base group:
# pacstrap /mnt base

   Other packages or groups can be installed by appending their names to
   the above command (space separated), possibly including the boot
   loader.

  Configure the system

   Generate an fstab file (use -U or -L to define by UUID or labels):
# genfstab -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

   Change root into the new system:
# arch-chroot /mnt

   Set the hostname:
# echo computer_name > /etc/hostname

   Set the time zone:
# ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone/subzone /etc/localtime

   Uncomment the needed locales in /etc/locale.gen, then generate them
   with:
# locale-gen

   Set locale preferences in /etc/locale.conf and possibly
   $HOME/.config/locale.conf:
# echo LANG=your_locale > /etc/locale.conf

   Add console keymap and font preferences in /etc/vconsole.conf.

   Configure the network for the newly installed environment: see Network
   configuration and Wireless network configuration.

   Configure /etc/mkinitcpio.conf if additional features are needed.
   Create a new initial RAM disk with:
# mkinitcpio -p linux

   Set the root password:
# passwd

  Install a boot loader

   See Boot loaders for the available choices and configuration.

  Reboot

   Exit the chroot environment by typing exit or pressing Ctrl+D.

   Optionally manually unmount all the partitions with umount -R /mnt:
   this allows noticing any "busy" partitions, and finding the cause with
   fuser.

   Finally, restart the machine by typing reboot: any partitions still
   mounted will be automatically unmounted by systemd. Remember to remove
   the installation media and then login into the new system with the root
   account.

Post-installation

   See General recommendations for system management directions and
   post-installation tutorials (like setting up a graphical user
   interface, sound or a touchpad).

   For a list of applications that may be of interest, see List of
   applications.
